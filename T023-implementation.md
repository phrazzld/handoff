# T023 Implementation: Run go mod tidy

## Implementation Summary

This task involved running `go mod tidy` in the project root to ensure that module dependencies are clean and consistent after all code changes.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Checked Current Module State

First, examined the current state of module files:
- `go.mod` contained only the module directive and Go version
- `go.sum` did not exist

```
module github.com/phrazzld/handoff

go 1.22.3
```

### 2. Ran go mod tidy

Executed `go mod tidy` in the project root:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

The command ran successfully without errors.

### 3. Verified Results

After running `go mod tidy`:
- No changes were made to `go.mod`
- No `go.sum` file was created

This is expected behavior since the project does not have any external dependencies. The `go.mod` file simply declares the module name and Go version.

### 4. Verified Project Integrity

Built the project and ran tests to ensure everything still works:

```bash
go build
```

The project built successfully.

There was a note about the examples package not building when running `go test ./...` due to multiple `main` functions, but this is expected behavior and not related to `go mod tidy`. The examples are meant to be run individually, not as a test package.

## Analysis

The project is currently very clean in terms of dependencies:
- It has no external dependencies
- It uses only the Go standard library
- The module configuration is minimal and correct

This simplicity is a positive attribute, making the project easy to integrate and reducing potential compatibility issues.

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ `go mod tidy` ran successfully without errors
2. ✅ The project still builds successfully
3. ✅ No changes were needed to `go.mod` or `go.sum`

No commit for module file changes is needed since no changes were made.
