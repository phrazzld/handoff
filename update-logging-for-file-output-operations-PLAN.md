# Update logging for file output operations

## Goal
Add informative log messages for file operations, including verbose log for file path and confirmation when writing succeeds.

## Implementation Status
After reviewing the current implementation, I've found that we already have comprehensive logging for file operations:

1. Verbose logging for the resolved output path:
```go
logger.Verbose("Output will be written to: %s", absOutputPath)
```

2. Verbose logging for file existence with force flag:
```go
logger.Verbose("Output file %s exists, will be overwritten because -force flag is set", absOutputPath)
```

3. Success logging when file is written:
```go
logger.Info("Output successfully written to %s", absOutputPath)
```

4. Comprehensive error logging:
```go
logger.Error("Invalid output path: %v", err)
logger.Error("Error checking output file: %v", err)
logger.Error("Failed to write to file %s: %v", absOutputPath, err)
logger.Error("Output file %s already exists. Use -force flag to overwrite.", absOutputPath)
```

The current implementation covers all key file operations with appropriate log messages:
- File path resolution
- File existence check
- Force flag usage for file overwriting
- File writing success/failure

## Proposed Enhancements
While the current logging is comprehensive, I can see one minor enhancement that would improve the user experience and align with the requirements:

1. Add a more detailed verbose log message about the file writing operation just before it happens, to complement the existing success message that appears after writing.

This would help users with detailed logging needs to better understand the exact sequence of operations.

## Key Reasoning
The current logging approach is already robust because:

1. It uses the appropriate log levels:
   - `logger.Error()` for error conditions that require user attention
   - `logger.Info()` for important operational status that all users should see
   - `logger.Verbose()` for detailed information that only users running with -verbose need

2. Messages are clear, descriptive, and include relevant details like file paths and error messages.

3. The logging follows a logical flow of the operations being performed.

4. It provides immediate feedback for both success and failure cases.

The enhancement will add one additional verbose log message to provide even more detailed information about the file writing operation, making the sequence of events clearer in verbose logs.
