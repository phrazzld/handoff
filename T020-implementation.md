# T020 Implementation: Update examples/gemini_planner.go to Use Library API

## Implementation Summary

The existing `examples/gemini_planner.go` example was already using the new `lib` package, but needed some improvements to fully demonstrate the proper use of the library API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Required `ProcessConfig()` Call

Added the critical `config.ProcessConfig()` call that was missing in the original implementation. This is required to process the string configuration options into slices that the library can use.

```go
// Before calling ProcessProject, we must process the configuration
config.ProcessConfig()
```

### 2. Updated Imports

Updated import statements to use modern Go practices:
- Replaced deprecated `ioutil.ReadFile()` with `os.ReadFile()`

### 3. Enhanced Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation to better demonstrate how to use the library:
- Added detailed file header with usage examples
- Added extensive comments throughout the code explaining key parts
- Documented configuration options and their purpose

### 4. Added Content Statistics

Added the use of `CalculateStatistics()` function to demonstrate how to get information about the processed content:

```go
// Get statistics about the content (useful for LLM context limits)
chars, lines, tokens := handoff.CalculateStatistics(content)
if *verbose {
    fmt.Printf("Content statistics:\n")
    fmt.Printf("- Characters: %d\n", chars)
    fmt.Printf("- Lines: %d\n", lines)
    fmt.Printf("- Estimated tokens: %d\n", tokens)
}
```

### 5. Enhanced File Path Handling

Improved comments for the output file path handling to better explain the process.

## Verification

The updated example was verified by:
1. Building the example to ensure it compiles without errors
2. Running the example with various options to ensure it functions correctly
3. Verifying the output file is created correctly

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ The example now fully uses the library API correctly
2. ✅ All necessary function calls are included (including `ProcessConfig()`)
3. ✅ The example compiles and runs successfully
4. ✅ The documentation clearly explains how to use the library
