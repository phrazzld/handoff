# T024 Implementation Plan: Plan Initial Semantic Version Tag

## Overview

This task involves deciding on an appropriate initial semantic version for the library release and documenting the versioning strategy. This will provide a foundation for the future versioning of the library.

## Background on Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme with three numbers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- MAJOR: Increment for incompatible API changes
- MINOR: Increment for backward-compatible new functionality
- PATCH: Increment for backward-compatible bug fixes

## Decision Points

### 1. Initial Version Choice

The main options for initial versioning are:

**Option A: Start with v0.1.0**
- Indicates pre-release software
- Signifies that the API is not yet stable
- Gives freedom to make breaking changes in minor versions
- Common for early-stage libraries

**Option B: Start with v1.0.0**
- Indicates a production-ready, stable API
- Commits to backward compatibility until v2.0.0
- Shows confidence in the API design
- More appropriate for mature, well-tested libraries

### 2. Versioning Strategy

- Document how version numbers will be incremented
- Establish guidelines for when to bump major/minor/patch versions
- Define any pre-release version conventions (e.g., alpha, beta, rc)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Assess Library Maturity**
   - Review the current state of the library API
   - Evaluate test coverage and stability
   - Consider future plans for API changes

2. **Choose Initial Version**
   - Select either v0.x.x or v1.0.0 based on assessment
   - Document rationale for the choice

3. **Document Versioning Strategy**
   - Create a versioning.md file or section in the README
   - Explain SemVer usage in the project
   - Define versioning policies

## Recommended Approach

Based on common practices for Go libraries and considering the recent refactoring:

1. Start with **v0.1.0**
   - Acknowledges the library is functional but may undergo further refinement
   - Allows for API adjustments as real-world usage provides feedback
   - Follows the convention of many Go libraries that start with v0.x

2. Increment to v1.0.0 when:
   - The API is stable and well-documented
   - Comprehensive tests are in place
   - Real-world usage has validated the design

3. Use pre-release tags as needed:
   - v0.1.0-alpha.1, v0.1.0-beta.1, etc. for early testing
   - v0.1.0-rc.1, v0.1.0-rc.2, etc. for release candidates

## Verification

- Document the initial version and strategy
- Ensure the strategy aligns with Go module conventions
- Verify understanding by project stakeholders

## Success Criteria

1. Initial semantic version is decided (v0.x.x or v1.0.0)
2. Versioning strategy is documented
3. Decision rationale is explained
