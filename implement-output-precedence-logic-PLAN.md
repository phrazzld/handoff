# Implement output precedence logic

## Goal
Ensure proper precedence between -dry-run, -output, and default clipboard behavior. Order should be: Dry Run > Output File > Clipboard.

## Implementation Status
This task has already been implemented as part of the previous task "Add file output handling logic in main function". The current implementation in the main function already handles the output precedence correctly:

1. **Highest Precedence**: If `-dry-run` flag is set, the content is printed to stdout without modifying any files or the clipboard.
2. **Medium Precedence**: If `-output` flag is provided (and `-dry-run` is not set), the content is written to the specified file.
3. **Lowest Precedence**: If neither of the above flags are set, the content is copied to the clipboard (default behavior).

The implementation uses a clear if-else-if-else structure that makes the precedence explicit and easy to understand:

```go
// Handle output based on precedence: dry-run > output file > clipboard
if dryRun {
    // Highest precedence: dry-run mode
    fmt.Println("### DRY RUN: Content that would be generated ###")
    fmt.Println(formattedContent)
    logger.Info("Dry run complete. No file written or clipboard modified.")
} else if outputFile != "" {
    // Medium precedence: write to file
    if err := handoff.WriteToFile(formattedContent, absOutputPath); err != nil {
        logger.Error("Failed to write to file %s: %v", absOutputPath, err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    logger.Info("Output successfully written to %s", absOutputPath)
} else {
    // Lowest precedence: copy to clipboard (default behavior)
    if err := copyToClipboard(formattedContent); err != nil {
        logger.Error("Failed to copy to clipboard: %v", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    logger.Info("Content successfully copied to clipboard.")
}
```

This implementation satisfies the requirements of Task 4 "Adjust Existing Logic" and follows the "Flag Precedence" consideration from the original plan.

## Key Reasoning
This approach was chosen because:

1. It provides a clear and explicit precedence order that's easy to understand from the code structure.
2. It uses descriptive comments to make the precedence order even more explicit.
3. It aligns with the original plan's recommendation for flag precedence.
4. The if-else-if-else structure makes it easy to extend if additional output methods are added in the future.
5. Each output method has appropriate success and error messages, improving user experience.
