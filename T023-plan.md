# T023 Implementation Plan: Run go mod tidy

## Overview

This task involves running `go mod tidy` in the project root to ensure that the module dependencies are cleaned up and consistent. This is an important step after completing the code and test changes that might have affected dependencies.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Check Current Module Files**
   - Examine the existing `go.mod` and `go.sum` files
   - Note their current state

2. **Run go mod tidy**
   - Execute `go mod tidy` in the project root
   - Observe any changes made to `go.mod` and `go.sum`

3. **Verify No Breaking Changes**
   - Build the project to ensure everything still compiles
   - Run tests to ensure they still pass

4. **Commit Changes if Necessary**
   - If changes were made to `go.mod` or `go.sum`, commit them

## Technical Implementation Details

The `go mod tidy` command does the following:
- Adds any missing modules necessary to build the project's packages
- Removes modules that aren't needed anymore
- Updates `go.mod` and `go.sum` files accordingly

This ensures that the module dependency information is accurate and minimal.

## Verification

- Build the project to ensure it compiles successfully after running `go mod tidy`
- Run tests to ensure they still pass
- Check if there are any changes to `go.mod` or `go.sum`

## Success Criteria

1. `go mod tidy` runs successfully without errors
2. The project still builds and tests pass after running the command
3. Any necessary changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum` are committed
