# T017 Implementation Plan: Configure and Enforce Test Coverage Check for lib Package

## Overview

This task involves setting up GitHub Actions to calculate test coverage for the `lib` package and enforcing a minimum coverage threshold. This will help maintain code quality by ensuring adequate test coverage for the library code.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Check Current Test Coverage**
   - Run coverage tests locally to determine current coverage levels
   - Identify potential areas for additional test coverage if needed

2. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Create a new workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
   - Configure the workflow to run tests with coverage
   - Set up coverage reporting for the `lib` package
   - Define a minimum coverage threshold (85%)
   - Configure the workflow to fail if coverage drops below the threshold

3. **Document the Coverage Requirements**
   - Add information about coverage requirements to relevant documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Check Current Test Coverage

Use Go's built-in testing tools to calculate current coverage:

```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./lib/...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

This will show the current coverage by function and total coverage percentage.

### 2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file at `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Test Coverage

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test with Coverage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: ^1.19

      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./lib/...

      - name: Check coverage threshold
        run: |
          COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | tr -d '%')
          THRESHOLD=85
          echo "Current coverage: $COVERAGE%"
          echo "Required coverage: $THRESHOLD%"
          if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Test coverage is below threshold. Failing."
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "Test coverage is above threshold. Passing."
```

### 3. Document the Coverage Requirements

Add a note to the `lib/README.md` file about the coverage requirements.

## Verification

1. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
2. Verify that it correctly reports coverage
3. Test the threshold enforcement by temporarily lowering coverage (if coverage is already above threshold)

## Success Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow successfully calculates test coverage for the `lib` package
2. The workflow fails if coverage drops below the defined threshold (85%)
3. Coverage information is reported in the workflow output
