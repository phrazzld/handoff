# T022 Implementation: Verify go.mod Module Path

## Implementation Summary

This task involved verifying that the `go.mod` file has the correct module path set to `github.com/phrazzld/handoff`.

## Current State Assessment

The current `go.mod` file already has the correct module directive:

```go
module github.com/phrazzld/handoff

go 1.22.3
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Checked Module Path in go.mod

Examined the `go.mod` file and confirmed that the module directive is correctly set to `github.com/phrazzld/handoff`. No changes were needed as the path was already correct.

### 2. Verified Import Consistency

Checked all imports across the codebase to ensure they are consistent with the module path:

```bash
grep -r "github.com/phrazzld/handoff" --include="*.go" .
```

All imports were found to be correctly using this path:
- `handoff_test.go` imports `handoff "github.com/phrazzld/handoff/lib"`
- `examples/simple_usage.go` imports `lib "github.com/phrazzld/handoff/lib"`
- `examples/gemini_planner.go` imports `"github.com/phrazzld/handoff/lib"`
- `main.go` imports `handoff "github.com/phrazzld/handoff/lib"`

### 3. Verified Build Integrity

Built the project to ensure everything compiles correctly:

```bash
go build
```

The build succeeded without errors, confirming that the module path is correctly set and all imports are working as expected.

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ The `go.mod` file contains the correct module directive: `module github.com/phrazzld/handoff`
2. ✅ All imports in the codebase are consistent with this module path
3. ✅ The code compiles and runs correctly

No changes were needed as the module path was already correctly configured.
