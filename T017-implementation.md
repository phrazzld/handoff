# T017 Implementation: Configure and Enforce Test Coverage Check for lib Package

## Implementation Summary

The task of configuring and enforcing test coverage checks for the lib package has been completed with the following steps:

### 1. Current Test Coverage Assessment

Current test coverage for the lib package was measured using Go's built-in testing tools:

```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./lib/... && go tool cover -func=coverage.out
```

Results showed an overall coverage of 85.3%, which is already above our target threshold of 85%. 

Key functions with coverage details:
- Most functions have 100% coverage
- A few functions with lower coverage:
  - `getGitFiles`: 37.5%
  - `minInt`: 66.7%
  - `getFilesFromDir`: 71.4%
  - `ProcessFile`: 70.0%

Since the overall coverage is already above our threshold, no additional test cases were needed at this time.

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Creation

Created a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file at `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` with the following key features:

- Runs on push to main/master branches and on all pull requests
- Sets up Go environment
- Runs tests with coverage reporting
- Checks coverage against the 85% threshold
- Fails the CI job if coverage is below the threshold
- Generates and uploads coverage report to Codecov

The workflow script includes detailed output showing current coverage percentage and required threshold for transparency.

### 3. Documentation Updates

Updated the `lib/README.md` file to include:

- Information about the coverage requirements (85% minimum)
- Instructions for checking coverage locally
- Commands for generating visual coverage reports

## Verification

To verify this implementation, GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow on the next push to the main branch or when a pull request is created.

The local test coverage check confirms that the current coverage exceeds the minimum threshold, so the CI job should pass successfully.

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ Current test coverage is 85.3%, exceeding the 85% threshold
2. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured to calculate and enforce the coverage threshold 
3. ✅ Coverage requirements and verification process documented in the library README
4. ✅ Coverage reporting to Codecov integrated for better visualization

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. Consider expanding test coverage for low-coverage functions, particularly `getGitFiles` (37.5%)
2. Add a code coverage badge to the main README
3. Set up notifications for coverage drops in pull requests
