# T024 Implementation: Plan Initial Semantic Version Tag

## Implementation Summary

This task involved determining the appropriate initial semantic version for the Handoff library and documenting the versioning strategy. After careful consideration of the library's current state, maturity, and following Go conventions, a decision was made and documented.

## Decision Made

The initial version for Handoff has been decided as **v0.1.0**.

## Rationale for v0.1.0

The key factors that led to choosing v0.1.0 include:

1. **Recent API Refactoring**: The library has recently undergone significant refactoring to separate the CLI and library components, making it prudent to allow for potential API adjustments.

2. **Testing Maturity**: While test coverage is good (>85%), additional real-world usage will help identify edge cases and potential improvements.

3. **Go Community Convention**: Many Go libraries start with v0.x versions until their APIs stabilize.

4. **Future Flexibility**: Starting with v0.x allows making necessary API adjustments based on user feedback without violating semantic versioning principles.

## Documentation Created

A comprehensive `VERSIONING.md` file has been created that covers:

1. **Initial Version Decision**: Clear statement that v0.1.0 will be the initial version with rationale

2. **Semantic Versioning Principles**: Explanation of how MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning will be applied

3. **v0.x Versioning Rules**: Clarification that during the v0.x phase, minor version increments may include breaking changes

4. **Criteria for v1.0.0**: Definition of when the project will be considered ready for a v1.0.0 release:
   - Proven API through real-world usage
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Maintained high test coverage
   - No anticipated significant API changes

5. **Pre-release Versioning**: How alpha, beta, and release candidate versions will be handled

6. **Version Tagging Convention**: All releases will be tagged with the 'v' prefix (e.g., v0.1.0) to align with Go module conventions

## Verification

The versioning strategy was developed by:
1. Reviewing common practices in Go libraries
2. Assessing the current state of the Handoff library
3. Considering future development plans

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ Initial semantic version has been decided (v0.1.0)
2. ✅ A comprehensive versioning strategy has been documented in VERSIONING.md
3. ✅ Clear rationale for the decision has been provided
4. ✅ Criteria for future version increments have been established
