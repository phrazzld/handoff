# T022 Implementation Plan: Verify go.mod Module Path

## Overview

This task involves checking the current module path in `go.mod` and ensuring it's correctly set to `github.com/phrazzld/handoff`. This is important to ensure proper import paths and compatibility with Go's module system.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Check Current Module Path**
   - Examine the existing `go.mod` file
   - Verify if the module directive is present and correct

2. **Update if Necessary**
   - If the module path is incorrect, update it to `github.com/phrazzld/handoff`
   
3. **Verify No Breaking Changes**
   - If changes are made, verify that the code still compiles
   - Check that any internal imports are adjusted accordingly

## Technical Implementation Details

The correct `go.mod` file should begin with:

```
module github.com/phrazzld/handoff

go 1.XX  // Whatever version is currently specified
```

If the module path needs to be changed, the following should be considered:

1. Update the `go.mod` file with the correct module directive
2. Verify all internal imports are using the correct path (e.g., `github.com/phrazzld/handoff/lib`)
3. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure the go.mod file is consistent

## Verification

- Check that the code compiles successfully after any changes
- Verify that examples and tests run without errors
- Ensure the modules can be imported correctly from external code

## Success Criteria

1. The `go.mod` file contains the correct module directive: `module github.com/phrazzld/handoff`
2. All imports in the codebase are consistent with this module path
3. The code compiles and runs correctly
