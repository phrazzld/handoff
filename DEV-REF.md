# Software Engineering Best Practices

These principles guide us toward building robust, maintainable, and reliable software, always rooted in clarity, purpose, and continuous improvement.

## Commits
- **Conventional Commits**: Adopt structured commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) to clearly communicate intent.
- **Atomic, Semantically Meaningful Commits**: Each commit should encapsulate exactly one logical change. This enhances readability, simplifies debugging, and streamlines rollbacks.

## Logging & Observability
- Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) consistently across all environments.
- Generate detailed log files during development to accelerate troubleshooting.
- Include correlation IDs to facilitate tracing through distributed systems.
- Establish meaningful metrics and proactive monitoring dashboards aligned with user experience and business goals.

## Testing
- Prioritize high test coverage—unit, integration, and end-to-end tests—to ensure reliability.
- Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) wherever feasible to drive design clarity and robustness.
- Ensure tests are deterministic, repeatable, and efficient.
- Integrate automated testing into continuous integration pipelines.

## Documentation
- Document the **why** behind design decisions, using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).
- Keep documentation close to the codebase in markdown for easy maintenance.
- Regularly update documentation as a critical part of the Definition of Done.
- Balance high-level architectural overviews with practical, actionable onboarding guides.

## Architecture & Design
- Embrace modularity and loose coupling for maintainability.
- Clearly define API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Separate infrastructure and business logic clearly (e.g., Hexagonal Architecture).
- Design for resilience, incorporating graceful degradation, retries, and circuit breakers.
- Prioritize explicit error handling with meaningful, actionable messages.

## Iterative Delivery (Lean & Agile Mindset)
- Focus on incremental, deployable changes to maintain rapid feedback loops.
- Encourage experimentation to validate assumptions quickly and cheaply.
- Foster a culture that values learning from small, controlled failures as integral to growth.

## Automation & Tooling
- Automate builds, tests, deployments, and database migrations fully.
- Maintain robust CI/CD pipelines that enable continuous deployment.
- Standardize and containerize development environments to ensure consistency and reduce friction.
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) to guarantee environment parity.

## Security-First Mindset
- Assume all inputs and environments could be hostile; build secure defaults.
- Regularly perform dependency scans and vulnerability assessments.
- Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege across all services and systems.
- Default to encryption in transit and at rest.

## Performance & Scalability
- Establish and maintain performance benchmarks and baselines.
- Continuously monitor critical performance metrics (response times, throughput, latency).
- Ensure horizontal scalability and eliminate single points of failure.
- Include load and stress testing as part of your regular development pipeline.

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Regularly conduct retrospectives to identify opportunities for improvement.
- Cultivate psychological safety so team members freely critique and suggest changes.
- Treat technical debt as real debt—actively manage, prioritize, and reduce it.

Adherence to these principles ensures not just the delivery of software, but the cultivation of a team and a system that sustainably thrives.
