# Add integration test for file creation

## Goal
Add a test to verify that a file is created with the correct content when the `-output` flag is used.

## Implementation Approach
I'll create a new integration test function named `TestFileCreation` that will:

1. Set up a temporary test directory and file path
2. Prepare test content by creating temporary test files
3. Run the main handoff command with the `-output` flag pointing to the test output path
4. Verify that:
   - The file is created at the specified location
   - The content of the file matches the expected formatted output

To accomplish this, I'll need to:
- Use `os.TempDir()` or `os.MkdirTemp()` to create a temporary test environment
- Create some test files with known content in the temporary directory
- Call the handoff logic with mock command-line arguments including the `-output` flag
- Check if the output file exists and contains the expected content
- Clean up the temporary files and directories afterward

## Reasoning
Integration testing the file creation functionality is critical because it's a new core feature that users will rely on. Since the file writing code spans multiple components (argument parsing in `parseConfig()`, path resolution in `resolveOutputPath()`, and the actual file writing with `handoff.WriteToFile()`), an integration test is more valuable than unit tests for each component in isolation.

The approach of using a temporary directory isolates the test from the actual filesystem and ensures the test is repeatable and doesn't interfere with the user's environment. This also allows the test to run safely in continuous integration environments.

I considered calling the actual `main()` function directly, but that would be difficult since it calls `os.Exit()` in error cases. Instead, I'll leverage the existing code structure to call the same functions that `main()` would call, but in a controlled test environment.
