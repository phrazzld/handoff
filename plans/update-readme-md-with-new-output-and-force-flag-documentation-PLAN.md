# Update README.md with new -output and -force flag documentation

## Goal
Add documentation in README.md for the new `-output` and `-force` flags, including descriptions, usage examples, and behavior with other flags. Include clear explanation of file overwrite protection.

## Implementation Approach
I'll update the README.md file by:
1. Adding the new `-output` and `-force` flags to the Options section
2. Adding examples showing how to use these flags
3. Including notes about file overwrite protection
4. Explaining flag precedence (dry-run > output file > clipboard)

## Reasoning
The documentation needs to be comprehensive but concise, following the existing style and format of the README. I'll maintain consistency with the current documentation style while ensuring the new flags are clearly explained with practical examples. I'll include information about the file overwrite protection mechanism to ensure users understand this important safety feature.
