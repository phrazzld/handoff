# T018 Implementation: Update Main README.md for Library/CLI Structure

## Implementation Summary

The main README.md has been updated to clearly reflect the project's dual nature as both a CLI tool and a Go library. The changes support better documentation and user experience for both types of users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Project Introduction
- Updated the project description to explicitly mention both the CLI and library functionality
- Added a comprehensive table of contents for better navigation

### 2. Enhanced Features Section
- Restructured to highlight the dual-interface nature
- Used bold headings for each feature to improve readability
- Reworded descriptions to be more concise and informative

### 3. Separated Installation Instructions
- Created distinct sections for CLI and library installation
- Added Go module import instructions for library users

### 4. Expanded Library Usage Documentation
- Completely rewrote the library usage example to be more comprehensive
- Added package declaration and imports for clarity
- Included error handling examples
- Demonstrated all major library functions (ProcessProject, WriteToFile, CalculateStatistics)
- Added a reference to lib/README.md for detailed API documentation

### 5. Improved Examples Section
- Added a description of the examples directory
- Maintained the Gemini Planner example
- Added a placeholder for the upcoming simple usage example

### 6. Added Development Information
- Created a new section on project structure
- Added testing instructions with coverage information
- Mentioned the 85% coverage threshold requirement

### 7. General Improvements
- Maintained all existing user documentation on CLI usage, output formats, etc.
- Fixed link formatting and section references
- Ensured consistent styling and formatting throughout

## Verification

The README was carefully checked to ensure:
- All links in the table of contents work correctly
- Code examples are valid Go code with proper formatting
- Documentation accurately reflects the current implementation
- Both CLI and library use cases are clearly explained

## Success Criteria Met

2. ✅ Installation instructions cover both CLI and library use cases
3. ✅ Library usage is properly documented with examples
4. ✅ Project structure is explained for potential contributors
5. ✅ Navigation is improved with a table of contents
