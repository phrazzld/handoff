# T014 Plan: Add missing newlines at EOF

## Task Description
Add missing newlines at end-of-file (EOF) for all text files in the repository.

## Approach
1. Use a bash script to identify files without trailing newlines
2. Fix each identified file by adding a newline at the end
3. Verify the changes introduce only newline additions

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a bash script to find files missing EOF newlines
2. Execute the script to identify affected files
3. Add newlines to each affected file
4. Verify the changes with git diff

## Acceptance Criteria
- All text files end with a newline
- Git diff shows only newline additions, no other changes
