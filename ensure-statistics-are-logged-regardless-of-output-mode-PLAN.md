# Ensure statistics are logged regardless of output mode

## Goal
Verify that the statistics summary is always printed to stderr, regardless of whether output goes to clipboard, file, or stdout.

## Implementation Status
After reviewing the current implementation, I've found that statistics are already being consistently logged regardless of output mode:

1. In the main function, statistics calculation and logging happen *after* all output operations:
```go
// Calculate and log statistics
charCount, lineCount, tokenCount := handoff.CalculateStatistics(formattedContent)
// Count processed files from the content
processedFiles := strings.Count(formattedContent, "</")

logger.Info("Handoff complete:")
logger.Info("- Files: %d", processedFiles)
logger.Info("- Lines: %d", lineCount)
logger.Info("- Characters: %d", charCount)
logger.Info("- Estimated tokens: %d", tokenCount)
```

2. All logger methods write to stderr, ensuring visibility regardless of where the main output goes:
```go
// Info logs an informational message to stderr
func (l *Logger) Info(format string, args ...interface{}) {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, format+"\n", args...)
}
```

3. The statistics logging is not conditional on any output mode - it happens after the if/else block that handles different output modes (dry-run, file output, clipboard).

## Proposed Approach
No code changes are needed for this task as the current implementation already satisfies the requirement. The statistics are logged to stderr regardless of which output mode is used:

- When using dry-run, statistics appear after the content is printed to stdout
- When writing to a file, statistics appear on the console
- When copying to the clipboard, statistics appear on the console

This is the ideal behavior because:
1. Statistics are useful metadata for all output types
2. Writing statistics to stderr ensures they don't interfere with stdout when using the program in a pipeline
3. The unconditional logging provides consistent feedback to users regardless of output destination

## Key Reasoning
The current implementation is correct because:

1. **Logical separation**: The statistics logging is separate from and after all output handling logic, ensuring it always executes.

2. **Proper stderr usage**: All logging uses stderr, which is the correct channel for metadata and diagnostic information that shouldn't interfere with main program output.

3. **Consistent user experience**: Users get the same statistics feedback regardless of which output mode they choose.

4. **Standard practice**: Using stderr for logging while reserving stdout for program output is a standard practice in CLI tools, making the behavior predictable and compatible with Unix pipes and redirections.
