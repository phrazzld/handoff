# T018 Implementation Plan: Update Main README.md for Library/CLI Structure

## Overview

This task involves updating the main README.md to clearly communicate that the project now provides both a CLI tool and a Go library package. The documentation needs to be revised to reflect the new structure and provide usage instructions for both use cases.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Current README Content**
   - Assess the existing README.md content
   - Identify sections that need updates

2. **Restructure README**
   - Add clear sections for CLI and library usage
   - Ensure installation instructions cover both use cases
   - Update project description to highlight dual functionality

3. **Update CLI Documentation**
   - Ensure CLI usage instructions are clear and accurate
   - Document all supported flags and features
   - Provide examples for common CLI use cases

4. **Add Library Documentation**
   - Add a clear section about library usage
   - Provide import instructions
   - Include basic usage examples
   - Link to the more detailed lib/README.md for API details

5. **Improve Overall Documentation**
   - Add badges (if applicable)
   - Ensure installation instructions are up-to-date
   - Consider adding a table of contents for navigation

## Technical Implementation Details

The README will be organized into these major sections:

1. **Project Introduction**
   - Brief description highlighting both CLI and library functionality
   - Purpose and key features

2. **Installation**
   - Installing as a CLI tool
   - Importing as a library

3. **CLI Usage**
   - Command-line options and flags
   - Examples for different use cases

4. **Library Usage**
   - Basic examples
   - Link to detailed API documentation

5. **Contributing Guidelines**
   - Development setup
   - Testing instructions

6. **License Information**

## Verification

- Ensure the README correctly builds with proper formatting
- Verify all command examples work as expected
- Check that import statements and code examples are correct
- Confirm all links work properly

## Success Criteria

The updated README.md successfully:
1. Clearly communicates that the project provides both a CLI tool and a library
2. Provides accurate installation instructions for both use cases
3. Includes basic usage examples for the CLI and library
4. Maintains good organization and readability
